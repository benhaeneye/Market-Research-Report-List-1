<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combination therapy</li><li>Monotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>BCL-2 inhibitors target the B-cell lymphoma 2 protein, pivotal in regulating apoptosis. In the market, these inhibitors are categorized into combination therapy and monotherapy. Combination therapy involves using BCL-2 inhibitors alongside other treatments to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance, particularly in complex malignancies. Monotherapy, on the other hand, involves administering BCL-2 inhibitors as standalone agents, often in specific cancer types like chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both approaches aim to improve patient outcomes by effectively inducing cancer cell death.</p></p>
