<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Methane Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared Sensor</li><li>Catalytic Bead Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The methane sensor market primarily features two types: infrared sensors and catalytic bead sensors. Infrared sensors detect methane by measuring changes in infrared light absorption, providing high sensitivity and selectivity. They are ideal for continuous monitoring in various environments. Catalytic bead sensors, on the other hand, detect methane through a chemical reaction that generates heat, which alters the resistance of a bead. They are robust and suitable for harsh conditions but can be less selective than infrared sensors.</p></p>
