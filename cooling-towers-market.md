<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling Towers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit Cooling Towers</li><li>Closed-Circuit Cooling Towers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cooling towers are critical in heat removal processes for industrial and commercial applications. Open-circuit cooling towers utilize ambient air to cool water directly, allowing evaporation, which can lead to water loss but is efficient for large-scale systems. Closed-circuit cooling towers, on the other hand, circulate water through a closed loop, minimizing evaporation and reducing water loss. Both types are essential for maintaining operational efficiency in power plants, HVAC systems, and manufacturing processes, adapting to varying environmental and operational needs.</p></p>
