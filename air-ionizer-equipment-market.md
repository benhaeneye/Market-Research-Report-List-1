<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Ionizer Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan Base Type</li><li>Fanless Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air ionizer equipment market is categorized into two main types: fan-based and fanless systems. </p><p>Fan-based ionizers utilize a fan to circulate air, enhancing the dispersion of negatively charged ions throughout a room. This ensures effective air purification by targeting airborne pollutants. </p><p>In contrast, fanless ionizers operate silently without moving parts, relying on ion generation to neutralize particles over time. While they are generally quieter, their coverage might be more limited compared to fan-based models. Both types enhance indoor air quality.</p></p>
