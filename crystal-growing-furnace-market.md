<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystal Growing Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski (CZ) Method Furnace</li><li>Floating Zone (FZ) Method Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crystal growing furnace market primarily consists of two key types: the Czochralski (CZ) method furnace and the Floating Zone (FZ) method furnace. The CZ method involves melting a material and slowly pulling a seed crystal from the melt, producing high-quality silicon and other crystalline structures. In contrast, the FZ method utilizes a localized heating zone to melt and recrystallize the material, enabling the growth of high-purity crystals without contaminants. Both methods serve critical roles in semiconductor and solar industries.</p></p>
